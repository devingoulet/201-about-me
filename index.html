    <h1>Learn some things about me, I insist.</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    
        <p>I'm 23 years old, originally a student of communications. Now, I am attemping to learn this new school to combine
        my what I've learned thus far in college and a technical trade to be a marketable professional.</p>
    
    <h3>Work history</h3>

        <p>I've been known frequent bars and make a cocktail or two for a few bucks. 
        I've also been seen wandering around the vans store pushing shoes on people.</p>

     <h4>My Goals</h4>
        
        <p>My dream of dreams is to live and work in Los Angeles 
        for a tech company. I aim to contribute anything useful I can to the tech community, 
        while collecting surfboards and enjoying the palm trees.</p>
